Both new endpoints are now implemented:

Movies by Year:
GET /movies/year/:year?page=1&desc=true

Movies by Genre:
GET /movies/genre/:genre?page=1

Both return paginated results with the required fields.

You can test them with URLs like:

http://localhost:3000/movies/year/1995
http://localhost:3000/movies/year/1995?desc=true&page=2
http://localhost:3000/movies/genre/Drama
http://localhost:3000/movies/genre/Comedy?page=2
